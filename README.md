Hold Your Breath 
I made this app in the direction of Self Assement Test for respiratory problems.
It might be useful in detection of Covid-19 also. Although I am not claiming it.

As Coronavirus affects the respiratory system, monitoring your breathing capacity might help
in detction of the disease. One need to monitor their breath holding capacity few times a day, 
and see if over the period of time the breathing capacity remains same or changes.

The codes and the app is made avaiable in the github repo. 
I would be happy if someone can use it for further improvments or integrate in their own app. 
One can also think in making some app in the direction of Self Assement Test.
